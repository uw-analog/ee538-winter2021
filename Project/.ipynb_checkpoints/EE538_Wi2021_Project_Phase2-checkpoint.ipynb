    "The design project for this course is the design of a high-gain CMOS OTA with a single-ended output. The goals of the project are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - To understand and analyze the frequency response of 2-stage OTAs (Miller effect, gain-bandwidth, stability, RHP zeros)\n",
    " - To understand and apply gain-boosting to realize high-gain CMOS amplifiers\n",
    " - To understand the biasing of high-gain amplifiers with limited supply voltage (e.g. using low-voltage cascode biasing)\n",
    " - To understand the gm/ID design methodology, and apply it using realistic device models\n",
    " - To perform design verification in Cadence, including DC operating point(s), transient, and AC analyses \n",
    "\n",
    "The project will comprise two phases, each lasting several weeks. You will use the $2.5V$ $NMOS$ (*nch_25*) and $PMOS$ (*pch_25*) models from TSMC's 65nm CMOS process.\n"
